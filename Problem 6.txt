Problem Statement: -6
A retail company maintains a MongoDB collection named customer. Each document in this
collection represents a purchase and contains fields such as cid (Customer ID), cname
(Customer Name), amount (Amount spent on product purchase), and product_name (Product
Name).
Implement a MapReduce function in MongoDB to analyze the customer collection and
produce a summarized report that displays the total amount spent by each customer on
product purchases.



Code & Commands :

sudo systemctl start mongodb

sudo systemctl enable mongodb

sudo systemctl status mongodb

mongo

use ass6;
db.customer.insertMany([
  { cid: 1, cname: "ABC", amount: 2000, product_name: "Iphone Charger" },
  { cid: 2, cname: "XYZ", amount: 40000, product_name: "Iphone 13" },
  { cid: 3, cname: "PQR", amount: 50000, product_name: "Samsung S23 FE" },
  { cid: 4, cname: "MNO", amount: 55000, product_name: "Iphone 14" }
]);
var Mapfunction = function() { emit(this.cid, this.amount) };
var Reducefunction = function(key, values) { return Array.sum(values) };
db.customer.mapReduce(Mapfunction, Reducefunction, { out: "Customer_Summary" });
db.Customer_Summary.find();
