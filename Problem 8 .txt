Problem Statement: -8
Develop a student database to efficiently manage and retrieve student records (Student id,
Student Name, Class, address, grades, and enrolment details, subject name, attendance.
● Create Views to provide summarized insights into student performance and
attendance. (Consider the attributes which shows attendance of students while
creating view)
● Create Sequences to generate unique student IDs.
● Create an index on a table using student name
